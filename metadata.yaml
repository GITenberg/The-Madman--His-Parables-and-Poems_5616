description: Kahlil Gibran (born January 6, 1883 in Bsharri, modern day Lebanon, which
  was part of Ottoman controlled Syria at the time; died April 10, 1931 in New York
  City, United States) was a Lebanese American artist, poet, writer, philosopher and
  theologian. He is the third-bestselling poet in history after William Shakespeare
  and Laozi. Much of Gibran's writings deal with Christianity, especially on the topic
  of spiritual love. His poetry is notable for its use of formal language, as well
  as insights on topics of life using spiritual terms. [Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran].
